# relationalDBMSparser

Instructions
Students are tasked with designing a system similar to "Relax" that is capable of accepting text representing relations and relational algebra queries.

Example of a Relation:

Employees (EID, Name, Age) = {
E1, John, 32
E2, Alice, 28
E3, Bob, 29
}
Example of a Relational Algebra Query:

select Age>30(Employees)
Project Requirements:

Parse the given text and relational algebra query.
Convert the relations into a suitable data structure.
Convert the relational algebra query into an ordered list of operations.
Display the result of the query based on the provided relations.

This submission doesn't complete the assignment but shows the work I put into it thus far, covering the parser and talking about limitations and next steps
